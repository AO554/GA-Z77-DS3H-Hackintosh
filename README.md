# GA-Z77-DS3H Hackintosh Configuration
(Compatible with macOS Big Sur)

# !! Notice !!
This configuration uses ```Clover v5.1 r5126``` as the bootloader, although the Latest verison of OpenCore should work with an older version of the HFSPlus driver.

- Using Clover has normally meant (In my testing) that you should start macOS from Preboot (even if you don't have FileVault) if you are using macOS Big Sur and Higher -

# So what works?

Basically everything from what I tested ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

# Known Issues (Results may vary):

Uhh, create an issue if you see one?
