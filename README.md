# GA-Z77-DS3H Hackintosh Configuration

# !! Notice !!
This configuration uses ```Clover v5.1 r5126``` as the bootloader, although the Latest verison of OpenCore should work with an older version of the HFSPlus driver.
``` OpenCore Version is comming soon! With everything working including sleep! ```

- Using Clover has normally meant (In my testing) that you should start macOS from Preboot (even if you don't have FileVault) if you are using macOS Big Sur and Higher -
- **You will have to generate your own Serial Numbers and Board Serial Numbers using either Clover Configurator or GenSMBIOS**

# macOS Versions Compatible
as far as I should see this configuration should work from the releases listed:

macOS Big Sur (11.0)

macOS Catalina (10.15)

macOS Mojave (10.14)

macOS High Sierra (10.13)

# So what works?

Basically everything from what I tested ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

# Known Issues (Results may vary):

Uhh, create an issue if you see one?
